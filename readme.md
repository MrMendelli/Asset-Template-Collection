# Asset Template Collection

## Introduction

This is a collection of asset templates I have made for personal use and have decided to make public. Not all available platforms or planned templates are included. This is due to them being incomplete or that I have not started them. Origin templates were planned, but canceled as it is being replaced with the EA app. These were made for the [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com) community, but anyone is welcome to them.

## Disclaimer

My workflow is done primarily in [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/). While PSD documents are included, some functionality will be lost in Photoshop. Shape layers do not have the same level of control, and text layers will be consolidated as shape layers. It is recommended to use the Affinity Photo documents for full feature capabilities.

## Use
Each folder will contain a separate readme that explains the specific use-case for documents in that same folder, though these should be easy enough to repurpose for any needs.
